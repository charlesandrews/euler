STOP RIGHT THERE

This is a repo where I'm working on the Project Euler problems. If you are working on them as well, turn back
round and don't try to look up the solutions. You'll be much more satisfied if you work on them yourself.

There's no guarantee that these are correct, optimal or even good solutions.
